        <p>Mary had a little lamb,<br>
           Its fleece was white as snow;<br>
           And everywhere that Mary went,<br>
           The lamb was sure to go.<br><br>
          It followed her to school one day<br>
          Which was against the rule;<br>
          I made the children laugh play,<br>
          To see a lamb at shool.<br><br>
        And so the teacher turned him out,<br>
        But still he lingered near,<br>
        And waited patiently about,<br>
        Till Mary did appear.<br><br></p>
